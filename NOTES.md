## Code

- `println!` is a _macro_, not a _function_.
  - We know this because it finishes with a `!` 

## Tools

- `rustc` compiler
- `rustfmt` formatter

## Formatting

- C-shaped (one true brace)
- indents: 4 spaces, no tabs
- final `;` may sometimes be omitted (as in this example),
  - not recommended
